# old_lachouetteagence
Comparison website for the 4th module of Openclassrooms' WebDev path. This is the pre-intervention version.
## what this is meant for and how to use it
I've cloned this repo from Openclassrooms in order to host it on github pages to make it possible to compare it with the optimized version I have worked on for the project number 4 of the web developer path.
The use it's meant to have is to be checked out with such tools as Google Lighthouse, GTMetrix and the dev console of your browser.

To do this, connect to https://wilywildwilly.github.io/old_lachouetteagence/index.html and do your measurements.
Then, connect to the optimized version at https://wilywildwilly.github.io/lachouetteagence/index.html, do the same measurements and check the difference.

Again, this is not meant for cloning. Even if you've enrolled in the same path of the same school, please use the repo Openclassroom gave you.
